SPI H/W Development Platforms
=============================

Example applications are provided to test and demonstrate both the SPI master 
and slave modules.

To run the application app_xc1a_spi_example, an 
`XC-1A Development Kit <http://www.xmos.com/products/development-kits/xc-1a-development-kit>`_ 
is required.

To run the applications app_spi_master_demo and app_spi_slave_demo, a pair of 
boards, such as the 
`XK-1A Development Kit <http://www.xmos.com/products/development-kits/xk-1a>`_ 
are required.
The following ports on both boards must be wired together::
    
    XS1_PORT_1A
    XS1_PORT_1B
    XS1_PORT_1C
    XS1_PORT_1D
